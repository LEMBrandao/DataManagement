#Based on the output of str(hawks), can you answer the following questions?
#What is the class of the object hawks?  a: data.frame tibble
#How many rows and how many columns are in this object? a: 908 rows, 19 columns



#Create a data.frame (hawks_20) containing only the data in row 20 of the hawks dataset.

hawks_20 <- hawks[20,]

#Notice how nrow() gave you the number of rows in a data.frame?
  
#Use that number to pull out just that last row in the data frame.
#Compare that with what you see as the last row using tail() to make sure itâ€™s meeting expectations.
#Pull out that last row using nrow() instead of the row number.
#Create a new data frame (hawks_last) from that last row.
#Combine nrow() with the - notation above to reproduce the behavior of head(hawks), keeping just the first 6 rows of the hawks dataset.

# Selecting data with tidyverse

# Useful dplyr functions
#   select(): subset columns
#   filter(): subset rows on conditions
#   mutate(): create new columns by using information from other columns
#   group_by() and summarize(): create summary statistics on grouped data
#   arrange(): sort results
#   count(): count discrete values

#   containing the Tarsus values (currently in mm) converted to centimeters.
#   Furthermore, the Tarsus_cm column should have no NAs and all values must be less than 6 cm.
#   Hint: think about how the commands should be ordered to produce this data frame!
